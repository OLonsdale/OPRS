# Optician's Patient Record System

To install, download the source and extract it. Open the directory in the terminal and run `npm install` (you will need npm).

Once the dependencies have been installed, run `npm run dev` to open the server in a dev environment with nodemon.

This systems allows the staff of the opticians to log in and create patients, and record exams for that patient.

Default credentials used are `admin` for both the username and password.

It uses a MongoDB cloud server to store the information, and is built with node, meaning JS is used for the full stack.
