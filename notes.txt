export patient with exams?

Created case insensitive index over patients collection for user searching simplification.
More efficient than regex
E.g McCullough Mccullough mccullough should all return same record
db.patients.createIndex({"firstName":1},{collation:{locale:"en", strength: 1}})
db.patients.createIndex({"lastName":1},{collation:{locale:"en", strength: 1}})
Then specify .collation({locale: 'en', strength: 1}) after queries
